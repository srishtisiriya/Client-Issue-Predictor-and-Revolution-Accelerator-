This project focuses on building a predictive model for customer satisfaction ratings based on a dataset of customer support tickets. By leveraging machine learning, the model can predict satisfaction levels, allowing companies to proactively address potential dissatisfaction, optimize support resources, and improve service quality. Advantages include faster response times and enhanced customer experience. However, challenges arise from handling noisy data, such as missing values or imbalanced classes, which can affect prediction accuracy.
